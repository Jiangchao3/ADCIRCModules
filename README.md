# ADCIRCModules
Implementation of routines used to manipulate ADCIRC model files in C++. The code provides a C++ interface as well as a Python interface.

## Python
When the python interface is compiled, you will have a PyAdcirc library file. For windows, this will by `PyAdcirc.dll` and for Linux type systems this will be `_PyAdcirc.so`. In addition to the library, you will see `PyAdcirc.py`. CMake will attempt to install these files to the appropriate directory, however, the user can change this. The standard library (`adcircmodules.dll` or `adcircmodules.so` is also required to be in a location where it can be found at runtime (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Unix systems).

```
import PyAdcirc
m = PyAdcirc.Mesh("mymesh.grd")
error = m.read()
```

## Note
This project is still under development.
