 * \class QKdtree2
 *
 * \brief Class that serves as an interface to the kdtree2 library
 *
 * This function serves as the C++ interface to the kdtree2 library. Kdtree2
 * requires the boost library headers that are included with this code. This
 * implementatin
 * currently only supports 2-dimensional searches, though the kd-tree library
 * this interfaces with does not have such a limitation
